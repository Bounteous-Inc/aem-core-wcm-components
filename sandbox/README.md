# AEM Core WCM Components Sandbox

The Sandbox represents a space where work-in-progress versions of the Core Components are developed. They provide _beta features_ and *should not be used in production*. When the components become stable, they will be promoted to new production-ready releases and moved out of the `sandbox` folder.

If you want to experiment with the Sandbox features, please install the Sandbox artifacts on top of the other modules. For more details check the [root README file](../README.md).
