Teaser (v1 - sandbox)
====
Teaser component written in HTL.

## Features

### Use Object
The Teaser component uses the `com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.sandbox.models.Teaser` Sling model as its Use-object.

### Component policy configuration properties
The following configuration properties are inherited from the image component:

1. `./allowedWidths` - defines the allowed renditions (as an integer array) that will be generated for the images rendered by this
component; the actual size will be requested by the client device;
2. `./disableLazyLoading` - allows to disable lazy loading for images (loading the image only when the image is visible on the client
device)

### Edit dialog properties
The following properties are written to JCR for this Teaser component and are expected to be available as `Resource` properties:

1. `./fileReference` property or `file` child node - will store either a reference to the image file, or the image file
2. `./linkURL` - required URL to which the teaser will link to
3. `./linkText` - Call to Action link text
4. `./jcr:title` - defines the value of the teaser title and HTML `title` attribute of the teaser image
5. `./jcr:description` - defines the value of the teaser description
